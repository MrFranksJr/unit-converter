# Unit Converter - Metric/Imperial


## Overview

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)

The assignment was to make a simple unit converter (Imperial -> Metric and vice versa)


The following were the base requirements of the assignment:
* Create the first post
* Use semantic HTML
* Add hover effects on the icons (Like, Comment, Share)

## Development

This project was really quick and easy. Conversions of units are basically small calculations.
I did it as efficiently as I could; just made sure all calcs are done in one function and there's only one DOM manipulation at the end.

Since the app was pretty bright and glary, I set a stretch goal for myself: implement a light- and dark-mode function.
It started with the design of some button using only HTML and CSS I found on youtube. Really found a lot of interesting stuff on pseudo-classes I didn't know nothing about.

On top of that, I extended the stretch goal by implementing a function that reads the system's setting of light or darkmode. I still don't think I fully understand how it works ðŸ˜‚ But it's a step in the right direction, it was a blast when it worked.

When you change the theme, it is saved to LocalStorage, so your preference is kept ^^

Ah, and I added Fahrenheit conversion too, cause I needed that one the most haha.

## Conclusion

In essence, this was not too complex to do. However, I was able to challenge myself and add a couple of interesting additional features.
