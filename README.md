# Unit Converter - Metric/Imperial


## Overview

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)

The assignment was to make a simple unit converter (Imperial -> Metric and vice versa)


The following were the base requirements of the assignment:
* Create the first post
* Use semantic HTML
* Add hover effects on the icons (Like, Comment, Share)
